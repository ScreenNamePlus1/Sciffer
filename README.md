## üõ†Ô∏è Features

* **Interactive Packet Capture:** Sniff a specified number of network packets directly from your terminal.
* **Detailed Packet Inspection:** View summaries and detailed layer-by-layer information of captured packets.
* **On-the-Fly Packet Modification:** Interactively edit various packet headers (IP addresses, TCP/UDP ports, TCP flags) and the raw payload (in hexadecimal format).
* **Flexible Sending Options:** Choose to transmit modified packets at Layer 3 (IP) using `send()` or Layer 2 (Ethernet) using `sendp()`.
* **Clear User Interface:** Simple and intuitive command-line prompts guide you through the packet manipulation process.
* **Educational and Experimental:** Ideal for learning about network protocols, debugging network issues, and experimenting with packet crafting.
